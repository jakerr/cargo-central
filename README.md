This is cargo central, the central community package index for the [cargo
package manager][1] that ships with the [Rust programming language][2].

If you want to register a new package with cargo, you can fork and edit
the `packages.json` file here. It should be pretty obvious what to add.
If you want more details on how all this works, see the linked wiki pages.
